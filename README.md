## Hey! I'm Jaxon.
If you're here, you probably already know that though. So let's cut to the chase! I'm a Florida grown 
website developer working in PHP, JS, vanilla html/css, and more, with a passion for integrating technology into our lives and technology. 

## ‚ùìwhoami
I started out with tasks for things I needed, like building a scraper with python that would alert me to the best deals for my first ever 
super computer, an HP pavillion slim series. After acquiring the gear I needed, I started coding new additions to my favorite game, 
Half-Life 2, in GLua that I would put on my very own server: A game server for up to 10 players with everything I wanted coded 
to the exact pixel I wanted it. No game is completele without a webpage to give you the long awaited "Welcome!" you get before 
diving in, so I built my own static site using vanilla css and html. I now had my server, website, and a computer from 2010 to 
run it all on. I had unknowingly planned out a multi-platform project for something I was interested in and executed it to my set standards. 

Fast-forward to present and I work to provide web engineering services written in PHP, JS, and so much to over 400 clients in my current position in a fashion very similar to my roots. 

Aside from technology, I am a dedicated mycologist and work to cultivate mushrooms in the comfort of my home! And I have 3 dogs!
