    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="bio-text">
      I started with projects for things I wanted but didn‚Äôt have yet‚Äîlike a Python scraper to hunt down the best deals
      on my dream ‚Äúsupercomputer,‚Äù an HP Pavilion Slim. After gathering all my gear, I dove into coding, adding features
      to my favorite game, Half-Life 2, in GLua. I even set up my own game server, built exactly the way I wanted it, down
      to the pixel, for up to 10 players.</br></br>

      Of course, no game is complete without a welcoming webpage! So, I created a static site with HTML and CSS. I had no clue
      what the heck a "framework" was so of course this was all vanilla/hand styled. By the end, I had my server, a website,
      and a 2010 computer holding it all together‚Äîa multi-platform project I hadn‚Äôt even realized I was planning but executed
      to my own high standards.</br></br>

      Fast forward to today, and I‚Äôm still building: now providing web engineering services in PHP, JavaScript, and more
      for over 400 clients. My journey may have started with personal projects, but the approach remains much the same.</br></br>

      Outside of tech, I‚Äôm a dedicated mycologist, cultivating mushrooms right in my own home‚Äîand I‚Äôve got three dogs who
      happily supervise my mushroom-growing adventures.

            JaxonvilleMushrooms is a website/project of mine built using WPEngine.
            I am an avid mycologist (someone who works with fungi) and do great amounts
            of research and cultivation in my free time; Growing a handful of delicious
            species like lions mane and pioppino. Mushrooms have been around as long as time,
            and most of the websites that provide much needed information to get started in the
            hobby seem to be made from around the same era! More often than not, they are confusing,
            outdated, and not properly maintained. Additionally, it's incredibly easy to get lost in the
            scope of the entire hobby and the hundreds of things you can do, but
            probably shouldn't do. My objective with this website is to give back to the
            community through resources and information presented in a way that makes sense to someone just starting out.

            This is the heart of my self-hosted infrastructure‚Äîa homelab built to explore,
            automate, and protect. Powered by Proxmox for virtualization and pfSense for
            firewalling, DMZ, and VLAN segmentation, this project demonstrates, in part, my experience
            with recreating enterprise-level infrastructure
            networking in a home environment. I‚Äôve set up a dedicated NAT/DMZ layer to
            keep internal services secure and isolated, with web apps safely exposed
            through Cloudflare reverse proxies.</br></br>

            To keep things visible and accountable,
            I've built a real-time status page using Uptime Kuma, Grafana, and InfluxDB
            offering live service health metrics at a glance. From automatic backups
            to smart routing, this lab represents my ongoing investment in learning
            infrastructure, solving real problems with scalable, automatable, and secure solutions.
