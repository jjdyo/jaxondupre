## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm Jaxon â€” a Software Developer with a strong foundation in fullstack development, system architecture, and automation. I specialize in [Drupal, Laravel, PHP, HTML/CSS/JS, and more](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaxondupre/overlay/1753901432123/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAADK47J4BwrtlBq38O3jOI_SSKLfJUl8b45k). If I don't understand something, I will make sure I do soon.

Beyond traditional web development, I manage a variety of self-hosted services in my homelab, including [Uptime Kuma](https://status.jaxonville.com/status/homelab), Trilium, VPNs, and pfSense virtualization. I design secure network architectures using Cloudflare proxies and implement real-time monitoring with Grafana and InfluxDB.

Outside of software, my interests extend into [3D printing, basic electrical engineering, and mechanical/automotive engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaxondupre/details/projects/). I take pride in maintaining a diverse skill setâ€”allowing me to build the things I need while continuously expanding my knowledge to do more.

I'm also the creator of [JaxonvilleMushrooms](https://jaxonvillemushrooms.com/), a WordPress-powered educational site where I share my work in mycology, e-commerce, and content development.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### [JaxonDupre - Portfolio](https://github.com/jjdyo/jaxondupre)
**An accessible static website built in Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS**

The business card for the tech world: This site is more than just a showcaseâ€”it's an open invitation to connect, collaborate, and create something meaningful. Here, you'll find a blend of my professional work and the personality that drives it. Life isn't as black and white as this website's palette, but together, we can leave behind a legacy of colorful, impactful work and inspire those around us to do the same.

### [JaxonvilleMushrooms](https://jaxonvillemushrooms.com)
**Mushroom gear, blogs, education, and more from Jaxon in Jacksonville.**

JaxonvilleMushrooms is a website/project of mine built using WPEngine. I am an avid mycologist (someone who works with fungi) and do great amounts of research and cultivation in my free time; Growing a handful of delicious species like Lions mane and pioppino. Mushrooms have been around as long as time, and most of the websites that provide much-needed information to get started in the hobby seem to be made from around the same era! More often than not, they are confusing, outdated, and not properly maintained. My objective with this website is to give back to the community through resources and information presented in a way that makes sense to someone just starting out.

### [Homelab â€” Virtualization of all types](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaxondupre/details/projects/)
**Proxmox, pfSense, and self-hosted services.**

This is the heart of my self-hosted infrastructureâ€”a homelab built to explore, automate, and protect. Powered by Proxmox for virtualization and pfSense for firewalling, DMZ, and VLAN segmentation, this project demonstrates, in part, my experience with recreating enterprise-level infrastructure networking in a home environment. I've set up a dedicated NAT/DMZ layer to keep internal services secure and isolated, with web apps safely exposed through Cloudflare reverse proxies.

To keep things visible and accountable, I've built a real-time status page using Uptime Kuma, Grafana, and InfluxDB offering live service health metrics at a glance. From automatic backups to smart routing, this lab represents my ongoing investment in learning infrastructure, solving real problems with scalable, automatable, and secure solutions.
